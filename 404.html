    CUSTOMIZING ROUTE HANDLING
    If you want more elaborate route handling, just include some additional JavaScript logic in the
    script tag shown above. You can tweak several things: the composition of the href that you pass
    to the index.html page; which pages should remain on the 404 page (via dynamic removal of the
    meta tag); and any other logic you want to put in place to dictate what content is shown based
    on the inbound route.
    512 MAGICAL BYTES
    This is, hands down, one of the strangest quirks I have ever encountered in web development.
    You must ensure that the total size of your 404.html page is greater than 512 bytes, because
    if it isnâ€™t, Internet Explorer will disregard it and show a generic browser 404 page instead.
    When I finally figured this out, I had to crack open a beer to cope with the amount of time it
    took.
