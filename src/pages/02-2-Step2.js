            When thinking about which bank to go with, Chase or Amex, a lot more goes into it rather
            than just which company is partnered up with the most airlines, or which company will
            get me the most miles for my points. While that is important, it&#x2019;s not what
            should be at the forefront of your mind when picking a credit card rewards program.
          </p>
          <p>
            The most important question you should ask yourself is this: which city or which country
            do I want to travel to the most? Once you have that answered, ask yourself this: which
            airlines fly there?
          </p>
          <p>
            If you picked a major travel destination, then most popular airlines will fly there.
            But you may also find some other airlines flying to your destination that you
            didn&#x2019;t expect, airlines like Korean Air or Alaskan Air. You shouldn&#x2019;t
            brush these lesser known airlines aside. Some of them have major perks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now comes some more questions: depending on which airlines fly to my destination,
            how many miles does each require to get there? And are fees added on
            top of miles?
          </p>
          <p>
            This is where you really have to do research. Go to all the airlines that can fly to
            your one must-have destination and start searching for travel dates. Which airlines
            require more miles? Does the date range affect the amount of miles? Can you be flexible
            with dates that are less expensive? Is there an airline that will take a mixture of
            miles and cash? Or does all travel involving miles require you to book the whole trip
            in miles? Which airlines charge fees, taxes, or fuel surcharges on top of bookings with
            miles?
          </p>
          <p>
            You&#x2019;ll quickly see that not all airline rewards programs are create equal.
            Depending on how many credit card points you can get, and the transfer rate between
            points to miles, you may be looking at a long time to gather up enough points for those
            miles or a short time (especially if you get a big sign-up bonus).
          </p>
          <p>
            Breathe deep and stay calm during this process. This is the hardest part and it can get
            hairy fast. There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with putting the computer away and coming back
            to search more later. Remember! You&#x2019;re not trying to book travel for next week
            or next month (at least you shouldn&#x2019;t be if you&#x2019;re following this plan).
            Be patient. You&#x2019;ll find something.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you have a sense of which airlines have the best deals on miles for your
            destination, go back to the credit cards and their rewards chart. Weigh your options.
            You may not get a perfect deal, but you&#x2019;ll have enough information to pick
            the <strong>best</strong> deal.
          </p>
          <p>
            When you find that one airline (or two, or three) that seem like a good fit for you,
            go to that airline&#x2019;s website and sign up for their rewards program.
            Don&#x2019;t be too hesitant about this. Airlines don&#x2019;t typically require
            anything when signing up for their rewards program other than your basic info. You
            don&#x2019;t even need a credit card to sign up or start earning miles. So even
            if you change your mind down the road about which airline go with, it costs you
            nothing to be a member of their rewards program.
