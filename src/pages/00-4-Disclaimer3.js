          The process I&#x2019;m outlining here is not quick. I would say it takes six months to a
          year to get all of this stuff in this guide done responsibly. Make sure you have at least
          that much time left until your big vacation.

          This guide also has a lot of information that may overwhelm you if read it all in one
          sitting. Thankfully, this guide will also remember where you left off if you decide to
          close the page. Feel free to stop and take a break and come back later.
