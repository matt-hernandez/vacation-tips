Mind you, I said income, not living expenses. When the end of the month rolls\n            around and all your living expenses have left your account, you should have one\n            month&#x2019;s worth of pay or more left over.

Let&#x2019;s break down what a credit\n            card rewards program is and how it differs from other things we&#x2019;ve heard of like\n            cash-back or airline miles.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            A credit card rewards program is something you can become a member of by applying and\n            being approved for a particular credit card with a bank. The banks in this case are\n            Chase and Amex. Both banks have several cards that allow you to enter into the rewards\n            program. The most popular cards with Chase are the <Link\n              href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/6/Q69RWB34CF\">Sapphire Preferred</Link> and\n            the <Link\n              href=\"https://creditcards.chase.com/a1/sapphire/DualA\">Sapphire Reserve</Link>.\n            Amex has their <Link\n              href=\"https://card.americanexpress.com/d/platinum-charge-card/gold-card/?\">Gold</Link> and <Link\n              href=\"https://card.americanexpress.com/d/platinum-charge-card/\">Platinum</Link> cards.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Every time you put on expenses on this card, the bank rewards you with points.\n            Typically, you&#x2019;ll earn 1 point per dollar. So a $14.38 purchase will net you 14\n            points.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            But sometimes the banks will give you more points based on what kind of purchase you\n            made. For example, the <Link\n              href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/6/Q69RWB34CF\">Chase Sapphire Preferred</Link> rewards\n            their credit card users 2x\n            points on travel and dining purchases. So if your $14.38 was spent on a meal at a\n            restaurant, you&#x2019;ll get 2 x 14 points, or 28 points.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n        <Banner icon={[ 'fab fa-cc-visa', 'fab fa-cc-amex' ]} color=\"#2086f3\" />\n        <section>\n          <p>\n            Each card has certain advantages and disadvantages.

But the <Link\n              href=\"https://creditcards.chase.com/a1/sapphire/DualA\">Chase Sapphire Reserve</Link> also\n            has a whopping $450 annual fee that is not waived the first year. If you get a <Link\n              href=\"https://www.referyourchasecard.com/6/Q69RWB34CF\">Chase Sapphire\n            Preferred</Link>, the annual fee is $0 the first year and only $95 after that.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            To make things a little more complicated, some credit cards will offer other unique\n            bonuses outside of points. For example, in exchange for paying that giant $450 annual\n            fee with the <Link\n              href=\"https://creditcards.chase.com/a1/sapphire/DualA\">Chase Sapphire Reserve</Link>,\n            you&#x2019;ll get an annual $300 travel credit that can be redeemed for lodging, paid\n            parking, taxis and ride sharing, and some tourist booking websites.

With all the talk of points and earning points, what exactly\n            are points used for? Why pick points first over cash-back or airline miles?\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Cash-back and airline miles are usually just that, cash back that shows up on your\n            credit card statement, and miles that you accrue with an airline company.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Points are different in that they are dynamic. You can trade them for cash-back, if\n            that&#x2019;s what you want, or trade them for airline miles, or hotel points, or\n            other things that the credit card bank offers. They can be whatever you want them to\n            be at the time you trade them.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            One major rule to know about points: when they&#x2019;re traded for any kind of\n            redemption, they can&#x2019;t be traded back. It&#x2019;s a one way street.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Second rule: some types of trades are better than others. Typically, trading points\n            for cash-back is one of the worst options. For Chase, each point is converted into 1\n            penny and then used as statement credit. Trading points for miles or hotel points\n            usually nets you much more monetary value than 1 penny per point.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Step1Continued;\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Banner from '../components/banner';\nimport Link from '../components/link';\n\nclass Step1WhatIDid extends Component {\n  static title = 'Step 1 - What I did';\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <Banner headshot={true} color=\"#22b8cf\" />\n        <section>\n          <p>\n            You’ve heard me talk a lot about Chase in the past few paragraphs. If you haven&#x2019;t\n            guessed, it&#x2019;s because I went with Chase instead of Amex.

That kind of bonus was\n            unheard of at the time and brought Chase a lot of publicity.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Ultimately, paying $450 for that sheer mountain of points made sense. And I also\n            made good use of all the other perks that came with the card initially (airport lounge\n            access, Global Entry application reimbursement, and the $300 travel credit).\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            I kept the card for almost a year. Once I saw that my renewal time was up, I decided\n            that I didn&#x2019;t want to pay $450 again.

Go to all the airlines that can fly to\n            your one must-have destination and start searching for travel dates. Which airlines\n            require more miles? Does the date range affect the amount of miles? Can you be flexible\n            with dates that are less expensive? Is there an airline that will take a mixture of\n            miles and cash? Or does all travel involving miles require you to book the whole trip\n            in miles? Which airlines charge fees, taxes, or fuel surcharges on top of bookings with\n            miles?\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            You&#x2019;ll quickly see that not all airline rewards programs are create equal.\n            Depending on how many credit card points you can get, and the transfer rate between\n            points to miles, you may be looking at a long time to gather up enough points for those\n            miles or a short time (especially if you get a big sign-up bonus).\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Breathe deep and stay calm during this process. This is the hardest part and it can get\n            hairy fast. There&#x2019;s nothing wrong with putting the computer away and coming back\n            to search more later. Remember! You&#x2019;re not trying to book travel for next week\n            or next month (at least you shouldn&#x2019;t be if you&#x2019;re following this plan).\n            Be patient. You&#x2019;ll find something.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Once you have a sense of which airlines have the best deals on miles for your\n            destination, go back to the credit cards and their rewards chart. Weigh your options.\n            You may not get a perfect deal, but you&#x2019;ll have enough information to pick\n            the <strong>best</strong> deal.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            When you find that one airline (or two, or three) that seem like a good fit for you,\n            go to that airline&#x2019;s website and sign up for their rewards program.\n            Don&#x2019;t be too hesitant about this. Airlines don&#x2019;t typically require\n            anything when signing up for their rewards program other than your basic info. You\n            don&#x2019;t even need a credit card to sign up or start earning miles. So even\n            if you change your mind down the road about which airline go with, it costs you\n            nothing to be a member of their rewards program.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Step2P5;\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Banner from '../components/banner';\nimport Link from '../components/link';\n\nclass Step2P5WhatIDid extends Component {\n  static title = 'Step 2.5 - What I did';\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <Banner headshot={true} color=\"#22b8cf\" />\n        <section>\n          <p>\n            Outside of the massive sign-up bonus with Chase, I also went with them because a blog\n            post over at <Link\n              href=\"https://thepointsguy.com/2014/05/what-will-60000-chase-ultimate-rewards-points-get-you/\">The Points Guy</Link> said\n            that 60,000 Chase points would equal 60,000 United Miles. 60,000 United Miles would\n            be enough for a round-trip ticket from most major US airports to Europe for almost free.\n            Some finagling with the departing and returning dates would be needed, but I was\n            ready for that.

In\n            reality, it&#x2019;s more complicated than that, but right now we just want to\n            understand the concepts.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            If I fly from Houston to Ireland, that means I&#x2019;m flying to Europe as my\n            region. I could just take a flight back from Ireland to Houston and be\n            done with it. But let&#x2019;s say I want to hangout in Germany for a bit. So instead\n            of going back home, I fly from Ireland to Germany. Then, after having fun in Germany\n            for a few days, I fly back to Houston from Germany.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            My flight from Ireland to Germany is my stopover. I flew from one region\n            (North America), to a different region (Europe), and then before coming back to the US,\n            I took another flight within the same region.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            What does all this terminology mean for us? Well, most airlines offer a\n            &#x201C;free stopover&#x201D; as part of their rewards program if a booking is made\n            entirely in miles. You can uncover this perk by searching for flights in the\n            &#x201C;multi-city&#x201D; category.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            As of this writing, flying from Houston to Ireland takes 60,000 United Points round trip\n            if booked on the right days (30,000 miles going over, 30,000 miles coming back).\n            But I want to add Germany to my trip. So I fly from Ireland to Germany and then back to\n            Houston. Does United charge me miles for this second flight within Europe? Short answer:\n            no.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            When using the United search, it will cost me 30,000 miles to get from Houston to\n            Ireland, 0 miles to get from Ireland to Germany, and 30,000 miles to get from Germany\n            back to Houston. I&#x2019;ve used the same amount of miles to go from one spot in Europe\n            to two.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n        <Banner icon=\"far fa-surprise\" color=\"#4c6ef5\" />\n        <section>\n          <p>\n            Now to get on to open-jaws. Let&#x2019;s say that I toss out Ireland and now decide\n            to fly from Houston to Germany. A round trip flight would be\n            the same 60,000 miles we&#x2019;re acquainted with. But let&#x2019;s say I want to take\n            the train over to Amsterdam and hang out there for a few days. Then, when it&#x2019;s\n            time to go back home, I fly back to Houston from <strong>Amsterdam</strong> (not\n            Germany). Does United charge me for flying back home from a different country? No.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            An open-jaw is exactly the same as a stopover, only instead of involving an added\n            flight within the same region, it just involves some other means of transportation\n            to get to a second point within the same region. Could be the train, a car, a bus, a\n            boat. Whatever.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            This makes sense since the airline isn&#x2019;t doing any extra work to take me to my\n            second destination. I&#x2019;m using my own means. My imaginary trip will cost me\n            30,000 miles to get from Houston to Germany, and 30,000 miles to get from Amsterdam\n            back to Houston. I&#x2019;ve again used the same amount of miles to go from one spot in\n            Europe to two.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Remember! These perks only work if the two points you are traveling to are within the\n            same region. So a flight from Houston to Ireland, then Ireland to Singapore, and then\n            Singapore back to Houston would not qualify for a free stopover flight. Ireland and\n            Singapore are not in the same region.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Also, different airlines will have different policies for stopovers and open-jaws.\n            What I&#x2019;ve detailed is strictly with United. Different airlines will have\n            different perks and discounts, and all of them will define regions of the world\n            differently. Do a Google search for your specific airline&#x2019;s policy and use their\n            multi-city search. See if you can squeeze out another stopping point nearby your prime\n            destination for either 0 miles or a discount.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Now comes the real kicker. Can I combine stopovers and open-jaws? With United, yes.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Step2P5;\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Banner from '../components/banner';\n\nclass Step2P5WhatIDidContinued extends Component {\n  static title = 'Step 2.5 - What I did (continued)';\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <Banner headshot={true} color=\"#22b8cf\" />\n        <section>\n          <p>\n            I combined 1 stopover and 1 open-jaw with United.

But it wasn&#x2019;t. 60,000 miles is the bare minimum for a\n            round-trip flight to Europe. But getting 30,000 miles going both ways was not always\n            possible depending on what days I flew in and out. I had to tweak which days of the\n            week I was leaving, and what time of day. I couldn&#x2019;t afford to be locked in to a\n            set schedule, so I made sure to book this plane flight several months in advance. Enough\n            time to get my PTO and other plans in order.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            If you want to make full use of combining a stopover with an open-jaw, you&#x2019;ll\n            have to get creative with what days you fly in and out. You should also experiment with\n            the order of cities you&#x2019;ll visit.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Originally, I wanted to fly from Houston to Amsterdam, take the train to Berlin, and\n            fly from Berlin to Amsterdam. But there were no bookings for that plan that allowed for\n            me to spend only 60,000 miles. So I changed the order and flew to Ireland first, then\n            to Berlin, and finally ended up in Amsterdam. Not only did I get the booking for 60,000\n            miles, I also got a killer amount for airline fees.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            And just to conclude on a personal note, even with two weeks and two days for travel,\n            three countries is a lot to see.

I\n            incurred a 3% fee for paying with a credit card, but compared to 100,000 Chase points,\n            it was a no-brainer.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Another time, when trying to get a sign-up bonus for a hotel card (which we&#x2019;ll\n            talk about next), I was getting ready to move into my own apartment. I had been saving\n            up for all the things I would need to make my new place liveable (furniture, small\n            appliances, a TV, house decor, movers). I waited until around my moving day to apply\n            for the new card, and then used it to buy all those things. I met my sign-up bonus\n            very quickly.

You now\n            have a credit card with a major rewards program, you got the sign-up bonus, you have a\n            travel destination and airline that you&#x2019;ll use, and you might have even added\n            one or two extra travel destinations to your itinerary.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            If you wanted to stop right here, you could. But if you want to try and go even further,\n            you can start to look up credit cards with sign-up bonuses for major hotel chains.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            One thing to note if you decide to this: wait until four months after you applied for\n            your original credit card to apply for the hotel card. You can ding your credit score\n            if you apply for cards too often. I&#x2019;m also not an authority on how many open\n            credit cards is too much. My personal rule is to never have more than six open credit\n            cards at a time. If you&#x2019;re about to go past this limit, proceed at your own\n            risk and with your own research.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Do a search on Google and see whether or not your travel destinations have major hotel\n            chains in the city. If you can find one or two that match, see if those hotel chains\n            have credit cards. Be aware that some may have annual fees.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            By now, you&#x2019;ve got training with getting one sign-up bonus. Now you&#x2019;ll\n            just repeat the same process for another credit card. Sign up for the hotel credit card,\n            put it on full auto-pay, move as many expenses over to it as possible without majorly\n            adjusting your lifestyle, and get that bonus.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            By now, some common questions begin to pop up. The first one is: what do I do with my\n            previous credit I obtained with either Chase, Amex, etc? Keep a few recurring\n            bills or monthly expenses on it. Credit cards that don&#x2019;t get used\n            regularly negatively affect your credit score. And whatever you do, don&#x2019;t close\n            the card. If you close the card that got you into a bank&#x2019;s credit card rewards\n            program, you&#x2019;ll also be removed from the program and your points may vanish.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            Another question I get it is, &#x201C;Won&#x2019;t opening up more than one credit card\n            negatively impact my credit score?&#x201D; As I said before, I&#x2019;m not an authority\n            on how many open cards is considered &#x201C;safe&#x201D;. However, if this\n            hotel card will be your third, fourth, or fifth card, most online sources say\n            you&#x2019;ll probably be okay. So long as the credit card applications we&#x2019;re\n            spaced out enough.\n          </p>\n        </section>\n      </>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\nexport default Step5;\n","import React, { Component } from 'react';\nimport Banner from '../components/banner';\nimport Link from '../components/link';\n\nclass Step5WhatIDid extends Component {\n  static title = 'Step 5 - What I did';\n\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <>\n        <Banner headshot={true} color=\"#22b8cf\" />\n        <section>\n          <p>\n            I applied for a <Link href=\"https://creditcards.chase.com/marriott/apply\">Chase Marriott Rewards</Link> card\n            after I got my <Link\n              href=\"https://creditcards.chase.com/a1/sapphire/DualA\">Chase Sapphire Reserve</Link> bonus and\n            after I waited for four months.

This one\n            was the Starwood Amex card. This card did not get me Amex rewards points. It got me\n            points with the Starwood hotel brand. Marriott and Starwood merged shortly before\n            I got this card. So when I got my sign-up bonus with Starwood, I was able to transfer\n            those points to Marriott and get four more nights in a middle-grade hotel.\n          </p>\n          <p>\n            <strong>Update:</strong> The Starwood card does not exist anymore because of this\n            merger.

See if you can\n            factor it into your life. Or maybe you really like the airline you flew on and you\n            want to sign-up for a card with them and get some bonus miles.
