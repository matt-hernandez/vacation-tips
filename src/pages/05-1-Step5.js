            If you&#x2019;ve managed to get to this point, you&#x2019;re sitting pretty. You now
            have a credit card with a major rewards program, you got the sign-up bonus, you have a
            travel destination and airline that you&#x2019;ll use, and you might have even added
            one or two extra travel destinations to your itinerary.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you wanted to stop right here, you could. But if you want to try and go even further,
            you can start to look up credit cards with sign-up bonuses for major hotel chains.
          </p>
          <p>
            One thing to note if you decide to this: wait until four months after you applied for
            your original credit card to apply for the hotel card. You can ding your credit score
            if you apply for cards too often. I&#x2019;m also not an authority on how many open
            credit cards is too much. My personal rule is to never have more than six open credit
            cards at a time. If you&#x2019;re about to go past this limit, proceed at your own
            risk and with your own research.
          </p>
          <p>
            Do a search on Google and see whether or not your travel destinations have major hotel
            chains in the city. If you can find one or two that match, see if those hotel chains
            have credit cards. Be aware that some may have annual fees.
          </p>
          <p>
            By now, you&#x2019;ve got training with getting one sign-up bonus. Now you&#x2019;ll
            just repeat the same process for another credit card. Sign up for the hotel credit card,
            put it on full auto-pay, move as many expenses over to it as possible without majorly
            adjusting your lifestyle, and get that bonus.
          </p>
          <p>
            By now, some common questions begin to pop up. The first one is: what do I do with my
            previous credit I obtained with either Chase, Amex, etc? Keep a few recurring
            bills or monthly expenses on it. Credit cards that don&#x2019;t get used
            regularly negatively affect your credit score. And whatever you do, don&#x2019;t close
            the card. If you close the card that got you into a bank&#x2019;s credit card rewards
            program, you&#x2019;ll also be removed from the program and your points may vanish.
          </p>
          <p>
            Another question I get it is, &#x201C;Won&#x2019;t opening up more than one credit card
            negatively impact my credit score?&#x201D; As I said before, I&#x2019;m not an authority
            on how many open cards is considered &#x201C;safe&#x201D;. However, if this
            hotel card will be your third, fourth, or fifth card, most online sources say
            you&#x2019;ll probably be okay. So long as the credit card applications we&#x2019;re
            spaced out enough.
